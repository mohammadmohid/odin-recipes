# Odin Learning Projects
## Project: Recipes
Used basic concepts of __HTML__ to design and layout a primitive recipes website.<br>
Also used basic styling with __CSS__ to make it look a little presentable<br>
__NOTE:__ This is only a learning project from the _'Foundations'_ course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)<br>
